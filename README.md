ShrimpEngine was one of my first bigger programming (Back in -08). I uploaded this since it's interesting to see how much you have developed as a developer in 8 years.

# Features
It had for the time a few innovative features. The biggest one was that the same binary was able to run on all Java-enabled phones (there where of course a few exceptions) despite having different screen resolutions or model-specific quirks on their JVM (I guess it was within the margin of interpretation of the JVM specifications ;)).

# Platform
J2ME (i.e. really old mobile phones running applications in Java)
